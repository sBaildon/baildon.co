Take the time to learn the foundations of nutrition. Food will be with you forever—a strong foundation will help you make more informed choices.

There are some common misconceptions we should dispel immediately:

- Fat doesn't make you fat
- "Healthy" foods aren't necessarily effective for fat loss
- Diet fizzy drinks won't kill you

Nutritional education is very poor, and when coupled with a boundless supply of readily-available hyper-palatable foods pushed by exorbitant marketing campaigns, there's no questioning why obesity is rising.

Changing the food you eat doesn't need to be—and shouldn't be—radical. There are no rules, only guidelines:

- Eat highly satiating foods. These are typically high in protein and fibre.
- Eat low calorie dense foods in voluminous quantities. Fruits and vegetables are good choices here.

I advise you to take a considered re-evaluation of the foods around you. Just because you have grown up in a highly-processed, sugar laden world, that doesn't mean we always have, or always will, and it certainly doesn't have to be "normal". There are other detrimental indulgences that aren't as prevalent as they used to be—smoking is one of those.

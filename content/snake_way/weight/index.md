Gaining and losing weight is considered a solved problem: eat in a caloric surplus to gain weight; eat in a deficit to lose weight. 

Anyone who tells you otherwise is incorrect. You only need look to professional bodybuilders, olympians, and actors to see that they're masters of body manipulation.

Written down weight change looks easy, but you already know it's not. The challenge lies in the battle with your finite willpower. Everyone succumbs to their cravings and regresses to bad habits from time to time. It's important to remember the road to success is filled with failure—pick yourself up, course correct, and continue the path.

Take the time to weigh your food. Whether looking to gain or lose weight it's _critical_ that you know the calories you're consuming. With enough experience, you'll learn to gauge quantities with rough approximations, but until then, weigh _everything_.

Be wary of frauds who sell dreams of unrealistic body transformations. Dreams are sold using compressed timelines, where people are lead to believe "fat to ripped" is possible in 30 days. Lying by omission is another trick—Hollywood actors build _real_ physiques, but never acknowledge the performance enhancing drugs that enabled them to exceed their natural limits.

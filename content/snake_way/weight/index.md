Gaining and losing weight is considered a solved problem: eat in a caloric surplus to gain weight; eat in a deficit to lose weight. 

Anyone who tells you otherwise is incorrect. You only need look to the masters of body manipulation—bodybuilders and actors—to see proof that energy balance is the mechanism for weight management.

Written down weight change looks easy, but you already know it's not. The challenge lies in the battle with your finite willpower. Everyone succumbs to their cravings and regresses to bad habits from time to time. It's important to remember the road to success is filled with failure—pick yourself up, course correct, and continue the path.

Energy balance is the mechanism, you need to employ a tool for it to work. There's no right or wrong here, it's all about what works for you. Let's take at some of the tools at your disposal:

## Calorie Counting
Conceptually the most simple: read nutrition labels, weigh the food you're eating, tally up the calories, and make sure the total falls within your goal range.

Calorie counting can be difficult at first because it requires significant discipline to weigh your food and makes eating out risky. It gets easier over time as you learn to guesstimate portions more accurately. 

## Fasting
Fasting is all about reducing total calories consumed throughout the day by minimising the window where you're actively eating.

If you're fasting until lunch time, there are 5-8 waking hours in the morning where you're not consuming food that you otherwise would. If you'd normally grab a latte and sandwich on your way to work, that's 600~ calories you've removed from your day.

## Low Carb, High Fat
By avoiding foods that are associated with poor satiety, LCHF diets are designed to prevent overeating without having to think about what you're eating.

Ketogenic diets are a specialised version of LCHF that almost eliminate carbohydrates because it's believed a diet devoid of carbohydrates convinces the body to burn fat as for fuel.

## Food group elimination
This is a bit of catch-all for different types of diets. 

- Cutting sugar from your diet encourages you to eat more satiating food, stop wasting calories on foods that provide no nutritional value, and even actively cause you to feel hungry.
- Of the three macronutrients fat contains 9 calories per gram, over double protein and carbohydrates, so eating foods with less fat content allows you eat higher volumes of other foods

Be wary of frauds who sell dreams of unrealistic body transformations. Dreams are sold using compressed timelines, where people are lead to believe "fat to ripped" is possible in 30 days. Lying by omission is another trick—Hollywood actors build _real_ physiques, but never acknowledge the performance enhancing drugs that enabled them to exceed their natural limits.
